    "description": "BLOODMONEY is a dark psychological clicker game where you need $25,000 for a life-saving operation. Meet Harvey Harvington at a roadside stall who offers $1 per click. You can increase earnings by buying tools that harm him - but every click causes pain. The moral choice is yours: stay gentle and earn slowly, or inflict harm for faster money. Your decisions will determine one of three possible endings.\n\nStrategy Paths:\n• Good Path: Use only harmless tools (feather) - hardest but most ethical ending\n• Normal Path: Mix of painful and gentle tools - Harvey survives but takes consequences\n• Dark Path: Use cruel weapons for fast money - leads to the darkest ending\n• Tool progression: Feather → Needle → Scissors → Fire → Gun\n• The gun ends the game instantly but with severe consequences for both characters"
